Jazmine And Dylan's Library Program

Create an app that models the school library. You must have: an interface or abstract super class. At least two subclasses descending from the interface/Super. Other classes not in the inheritance tree. Each object class must be fully formed with at least one unique attribute, a default and a multi-arg constructor, appropriate getters and setters, a brain method and a toString.
In the main method, instantiate objects and demonstrate a sufficient number of methods. Create an array or ArrayList of objects and demonstrate its use. Print it out using a loop.
